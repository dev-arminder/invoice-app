## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge I had build.

The challenge is to build out this invoicing application and get it looking as close to the design as possible

Users are able to:

- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
